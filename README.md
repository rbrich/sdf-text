sdf-text
========

Render text using Signed Distance Field technique.

Examples:
- `glyph.rs`
  - draw a glyph into texture and render it on a quad
  - `[F1]` filtering: bilinear / nearest
  - `[F2]` shader: SDF / straight
  - `[F3]` texture: SDF / monochrome
- `distance.py`
  - visualize algorithms for finding neareast point on bezi√©r curve
