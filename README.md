=======
Text rendering for Rust + OpenGL.

Currently in toying phase, not ready for anything.

Examples:
- distance.py
  - visualize algorithms for finding neareast point on bezi√©r curve
- glyph.rs
  - draw a letter (glyph) into texture, render the texture on a quad
  - filtering: nearest / bilinear
  - shader: straight / SDF
  - texture: antialiased / SDF
